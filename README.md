# Hourly Working

Doing [P90](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/programs/p90/workouts)? Don't have time for the video today? Do it bit by bit. Use this tool to track yourself.

## About This Project

I successfully did the first month of P90 before starting coding bootcamp. Month 2 completely fell by the wayside. Then I realized: If I broke the workout into bits and pieces throughout the day, it becomes much more manageable. I created this React project to keep track.

## Status

I've hard coded the exercises for the second month ("B") workouts. Nothing beyond that at this point.
